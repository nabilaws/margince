// dispatch.go routes a JSON-RPC method to a handler, and this decides what an

//
// The distinction every line here serves: an agent's next move depends on WHICH
// kind of no it got. "You may never" and "a human must say yes" and "you typed
// the id wrong" are three different instructions, and collapsing them into a
// retry is how a scheduled run spends its whole step budget re-issuing one

// WHICH argument and why, so they are what the agent gets — the same breakdown
// the REST body carries, rather than the flattened summary the outer code
// alone would give. The per-field MESSAGE is the half that says what to change,
// and it travels with them: a refusal naming an argument the agent cannot then
// fix is a refusal it will re-issue.
//
// The summary detail is not rendered beside those entries, because where they
// carry prose it is never a second fact. A Fields-bearing fault is built in
// exactly two places, and Detail is the same message again in one
// (httperr.Validation) and the flattened field:code list in the other (the
// FieldFaults branch, whose implementers write Error() for a log line). It is
// kept only when no entry carried prose, so the caller is never left holding
// names alone.
//
// Everything echoed is escaped and bounded HERE, rather than on a reliance on
// the classes that produce it being short and well-behaved: Classify bounds a
// message only on the module-declared path, so one from a direct Validation
// call reaches this point unbounded. The message needs both outright — it
// quotes the caller's own token back, since a refused plan names the target it
// could not resolve, into a transcript later prompts of this run read.
//
// FOUR FIGURES, and each answers a different question about whose words are
// being echoed. A classified fault's detail is OURS and names closed
// vocabularies, so it gets MaxFaultDetail. The per-field remedy is also ours
// and borrows httperr.MaxFaultText, the same number that package applies on
// the module-declared path. The flattened field:code fallthrough is the
// caller's own list, as long as they chose to make it, so it keeps
// maxBadArgsDetail.
//
// The field and the code get the same treatment because nothing in the taxonomy
// PROMISES they are ours either. A field slot fed from a caller-chosen key is
// one new fault type away, and a newline in it forges a frame exactly as one in
// a message would; the bound belongs to the position, not to the current
// occupants.
//
// A FOURTH figure sits beside these three, on the staged branch rather than in
// this function: stagedExplanation echoes an approval summary at
// workflow.MaxStagedSummary. It is listed here because this is where a reader
// comes to ask what the tool surface bounds and why, and a figure applied
// elsewhere but absent from the table is a figure nobody knows to keep true.
