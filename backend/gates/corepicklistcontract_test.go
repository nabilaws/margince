// The core picklist value sets against the contract that owns them.
//
// A filter builder offers a picklist's values instead of asking a reader to type
// one, and the sets it offers are declared beside the engine (collections'
// vocab.go) while the contract enumerates them in api/crm.yaml. Drift between the
// two is silent and runs both ways: a value the contract dropped stays on offer
// and selects nothing, and a value it gained is one no builder shows — which is
// the free-text failure the whole surface exists to remove, arriving one enum
// member at a time.
//
// Here rather than in the module, for the reason the root's other contract gates
// carry: this walks the authoritative 3.1 document rather than the generated Go,
// so a contract-only edit cannot slip past it, and collections does not take a
// YAML dependency to hold a claim about a document it does not own.
//
// Reading the document also lets the null be dropped deliberately. oapi-codegen
// emits a `<nil>` member for a nullable enum (OrganizationSizeBandLessThannil is
// real), so a set derived from the generated constants would carry a value no
// human should be offered; a null in the contract is the COLUMN's nullability,
// and `exists: false` is how a filter asks for empty.
//
// The COMPLETENESS half — that every core picklist offers values at all, that a
// retired one offers none, and that no offered value is empty or `<nil>` — is
// collections' own TestEveryCorePicklistOffersItsValues. This holds the sets it
// finds to the document, which is why an empty set is skipped here rather than
// asserted twice.
