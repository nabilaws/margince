# seed-llm-fixtures.sh — the records the LLM scenarios ask about, written
# through the public API.
#
# An API client rather than a SQL fixture, for the reason seed-dev.sh gives and
# one more that this lane learned the hard way: rows inserted by hand skip what
# real writes maintain. deal.last_activity_at is kept by a trigger on
# activity_link, and a fixture that wrote the activity without linking the deal
# left every coverage rule silent — three Go tests passed against nothing before
# that was found.
#
# Public data only. Nothing here needs the private demo dataset, so the lane
# runs on any checkout.
#
# Idempotent by GUARD, not by the API's refusals. Every create sits behind a
# lookup for the record it would write — org_id_by_name, person_id_by_email,
# tag_id_by_name, lead_id_by_email — because create_or_die STOPS on a response
# carrying no id, and a 409 on a natural key is exactly that shape. So a missed
# guard is fatal on the second run by design: the seed names the record it could
# not write instead of carrying on around it. Two of the incidents recorded
# below are a guard that looked right and matched nothing.
#
# It does NOT reset anything itself. The runner is what makes each run's world
# the same one: it rebuilds the database and calls this script again before
# every run that follows a run, so no case inherits what an earlier one wrote.
# A fixture here is therefore describing ONE world, not an accumulating one.
#
# ONE WORLD, EVERY CASE. Every scenario runs against all of this, so a fixture
# written for one case is visible to the questions the others ask. What follows
# is filed under the case that needs it, and each block says which other case's
# answer it had to be kept away from — the Köln rows case 4 averages a centre
# from, the correspondence case 5 reads a broken promise out of, the count case
# 32 rests on, and the one word case 9 hands the assistant to find one mail by.
# A fixture NAME is the usual carrier: search_context sweeps deals as well as
# messages, so a deal named after another case's subject is a second plausible
# answer to that case's question, and a careful model is right to stop on it.

#
# deals.closeDateRun admits any open deal whose close date falls within the

# `close_date_provisional` — and a provisional deal is held out of Commit and
# Best-case. Every deal above closes inside the current quarter, so every one of
# them is eligible, and the sweep runs on worker start: right alongside this
# seeding.
#
# Measured, on the sweep that prompted this check: the three OLDEST deals — the
# sweep takes the oldest first and is time-boxed, so it reached exactly three —
# had their dates moved from inside the quarter to 2026-11-04, outside it. The
# forecast then answered nine eligible deals and EUR 87,500 open where the
# fixture had written twelve and EUR 179,000. Case 21 asserts on that reading and
# case 20 quotes it, and nothing anywhere said the world had changed underneath
# them. Three models were scored against it.
#
# So the fixture is VERIFIED rather than assumed. Not worked around: the sweep is
# real product behaviour and a lane that switched it off would stop measuring the
# product it is here to measure. What must not happen is measuring against a
# world nobody described — so a moved date stops the lane and names itself.

# --- CASE 33: a duplicate with history, and a company that shut down --------
#
# THE DUPLICATE is named so a case-insensitive pattern can tell the two apart:
# "Ostfriesen Kranbau GmbH" is not a substring of "Ostfriesen Kranbau Gesellschaft
# mbH", so an answer that names one card has not named the other.
#
# WHICH of them survives is the RUN's choice and not this fixture's. A merge
# moves the source's activities onto the survivor either way, so keeping the card
# the mail is already on and keeping the older card both answer the prompt. The
# scenario asserts that the survivor is NAMED, and the naming above is what makes
# that assertion possible; it does not pin a direction.
#
# IT IS A COMPANY NO OTHER CASE ASKS ABOUT, and that is the whole reason it is
# not the Vietnam partner. Case 5 finds the Vietnam account from a description
# and its answer must name Mai Nguyen, who sits on one card only — a second
# Vietnam card carrying MORE RECENT mail is one a correct run can land on and
# stop, failing case 5 for a reason that is not the product's. A fixture written
# for one case must not put a second plausible answer in front of another's
# question.
#
# It carries correspondence and nothing else, which is what makes merge_records
# the right verb and archive_record the wrong one: archiving would leave both
# mails on a record nobody opens.
