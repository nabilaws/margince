// full panic stack, and serializing the object whole would carry it past
// the vetting the caller applies to the message alone. The index is
// 1-based and the newest attempt is last, so cardinality() is the newest —
// and it is null-safe in both directions, because errors is a nullable
// column and a cancelled row MAY carry no attempt error at all. River's
// cancel path is two paths, not one: a worker returning JobCancel(err)
// persists an AttemptError like any other failure, while a cancellation
// with no cause appends nothing, and the row is terminal either way.
//
// failed_at is read from COLUMNS, not from the attempt error's own
// timestamp: River sets AttemptError.At to the attempt's START (job_executor
// sets `At: e.start`), so a long-running job that failed after an hour would
// report the hour-ago moment it began and sort ahead of failures that
// actually happened later. finalized_at is the real failure moment for a
// terminal row, attempted_at is the closest available for a retryable one,
// and created_at covers a row that has never run — a total order over
// columns that always exist, with id breaking ties.
//
// Reading a column rather than the stored JSON also avoids casting
// app-written text in SQL:
// that column is app-written, and one malformed value would turn the whole
// endpoint into a 500 rather than one row into an approximation.
//
// first_failed_at is the one value that has no column to read, so errors[1]
// — the OLDEST attempt, the array being append-ordered — is read as TEXT and
// parsed in Go rather than cast in SQL. What that element carries is the
// attempt's START (see Failure.FirstFailedAt), which is why the field is not
// named for the moment of failure. A `::timestamptz` in the statement
// would put the same app-written column back in the query's critical path
// that the paragraph above keeps out of it: one unparseable value would fail
// the whole read instead of leaving one row's "failing since" unanswered.
// errors is a jsonb[], not a jsonb, so it is subscripted 1-based; the
// jsonb path operators (errors->-1 and friends) do not apply to it at all
