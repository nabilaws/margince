"""Why did a run not call the tool its scenario requires?

A failing `must_call` says which tool was missed and nothing about why. The
answer is almost always one of three things, and they need different fixes:

  the tool was never served        -> a scope, a tier floor, or a registration
  it was served and not chosen     -> the tool's own copy, read beside its rivals
  it was chosen and refused        -> the refusal, which the transcript carries

This prints the evidence for all three, per run, so the question is answered by
reading rather than reconstructed by hand each time. Reads only what the lane
already records; it drives no model and costs nothing.
