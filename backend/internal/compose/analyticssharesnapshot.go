// Serving a frozen snapshot to somebody narrower than the person who froze it.
//
// The stored headline is the sum over every deal the ISSUER could see. Handing
// that number to a recipient who cannot see all of them discloses a total
// covering deals they may not read — which is the aggregate disclosure the
// audience rules exist to prevent, and it does not stop being one because the
// rows behind it are hidden.
//
// So a snapshot share never serves won_minor and its siblings. It re-sums the
// contributions the recipient may actually read, and the headline it returns
// is a headline ABOUT THEM. A recipient who can see nothing gets zeroes and a
// count of zero eligible deals, which is the honest answer to what they asked.
