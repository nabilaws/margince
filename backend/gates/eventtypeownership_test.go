// One module owns an event type.
//
// The rule, written out rather than cited: a bounded capability owns the names
// it publishes under, so exactly one module decides what a given event type
// MEANS. Two modules emitting one type is how a subscriber ends up receiving
// the same name for two different facts — and nothing in the envelope tells it
// which happened, because the type IS the discriminator. The tables have a gate
// saying this (TestEveryPackageOnlyWritesTablesItOwns); the event types did not.
//
// Sharing is not always wrong, and the ratified set below is the proof: an
// overlay write-back announces the NATIVE module's event on purpose, because a
// subscriber to person.updated must hear about a person changing however the
// write arrived. What this gate refuses is a NEW sharer arriving unnoticed.
//
// It walks composite literals of the generated payload structs rather than the
// emit calls, which is what makes it sound over both outbox writers (storekit's
// and the hand-rolled INSERT in approvals) and over the six helpers that return
// one of several payloads by branch.
