// Destroying named records on a person's own authority, rather than on a
// policy's.
//
// Retention destroys what a POLICY says is too old. This destroys what an
// OWNER says was never the business's to hold: the mail their own mailbox
// brought in from a doctor, a school, a family member. The two arrive at the
// same place — the message text, its provider original, its vectors, its
// attachments, everything derived from it — and they must arrive there by the
// same code, because a second destruction path is how one of them quietly stops
// destroying something.
//
// So this reuses the retention executors verbatim and differs in exactly two
// ways: WHO decided (an owner, not a policy) and WHICH records (a list the
// caller computed, not a query over an age). Both differences ride the audit
// row, so a governance read can tell them apart.
