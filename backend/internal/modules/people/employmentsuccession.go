// Who a person works for once the job that answered that question ends.
//
// `is_current_primary` answers "which company does this person currently work
// for". The three moments a caller STATES something already keep it true — a
// person's only current employment lands primary, ending one clears the flag,
// and a job already over never takes it. This is the moment nobody states
// anything: the primary edge is retired, and the answer silently becomes
// nobody while the person is plainly still employed somewhere.
//
// ONE REMAINING EMPLOYMENT IS NOT A CHOICE. It is the only answer there is, so
// writing it invents nothing. Leaving it unset would mean the product knows the
// answer, has no alternative to weigh, and declines to say it.
//
// TWO REMAINING IS A CHOICE, and this does not make it. Picking between two
// employers on somebody's behalf writes a fact nobody asserted, and
// `is_current_primary` is a column humans set deliberately — that property is
// worth keeping exactly where it means something. The person is left with no
// primary employer, which is a state the reads render as such rather than as
// blank.
//
// Both doors reach this, because either alone leaves the same defect reachable
// through the other: archiving the primary edge, and ending it by patch.
//
// The per-person write lock lives here too. It is what makes every decision
// about one person's employment flags happen one at a time, which is the same
// question this file's promotion asks and the reason the two belong together.

// why. The candidate must be a CURRENT employment (date-aware: a job somebody
// leaves next month is still theirs, and a job that ended yesterday is not).

// than skip.
