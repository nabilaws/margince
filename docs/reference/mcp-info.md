# The served MCP surface

<!-- Generated together with mcp-info.json; do not edit by hand. -->

Generated from the served MCP surface by `go test ./internal/compose/ -run TestPublishedMCPSurface -update-mcp-info`; do not edit by hand. This is the ALL-SCOPE view: tools/list and resources/list are both filtered per caller, so a passport holding fewer scopes is served less than this. It is the CORE catalog: extension units register onto the same registry and are not composed here. It is captured as an Apps-capable host sees it, so a tool bound to a view carries `_meta.ui.resourceUri`; only a MODERN request that declined the UI extension is served no such member — the handshake era, which has no way to declare one, is served views. The `ui://` view descriptors ARE included, and a deployment publishes each only once its boot has fetched and admitted that document, so an api serving neither advertises neither.

`mcp-info.json` beside this page is the same surface byte for byte, as a client
receives it. This page is rendered from that file.

## Totals

| | |
|---|---:|
| Tools | 75 |
| Resources | 12 |
| Tool catalog | 211.2 KB |
| Resource catalog | 4.5 KB |
| Approx. wire tokens | 55204 |
| Largest tool | `prep_for_meeting` (8.8 KB) |
| Scopes rendered | `read`, `draft`, `write`, `send`, `enrich` |

Those are the WIRE bytes: they carry each tool's output schema and the governance
clause the transport appends. The Surface-B listing a run re-sends every step is
smaller — name, description and input schema only — and is held against its own
budget in `agenttooldescriptions_test.go`. What that listing costs each SCHEDULED
agent, agent by agent, is [agent-tool-budget.md](agent-tool-budget.md).

### What the tool catalog is made of

| Part | Bytes | Share | In a run's prompt? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Output schemas | 98.7 KB | 46% | **No** — a result's shape, never listed to a model |
| Descriptions (incl. governance clause) | 52.2 KB | 24% | Yes, every step |
| Input schemas | 44.5 KB | 21% | Yes, every step |
| _Names, annotations, punctuation_ | 15.8 KB | 7% | Partly |
| **Description + input schema** | **96.6 KB** | **45%** | **the recurring cost** |

So the headline total is dominated by the part a model is never charged for, and
descriptions are a minority of it. Trimming the copy to shrink the total trades a
MEASURED gain — the same copy took gemini's tool selection from 0.80 to 0.87, and
one restraint scenario from 0/3 to 3/3 on a single sentence — for bytes that were
not the cost. `agenttooldescriptions_test.go` records that argument and the
budget decision it produced; the room is bought by publishing a vocabulary as a
resource, the way `margince://schema/record-fields` did, not by writing less.

## Resources

A resource takes no arguments and changes nothing, so it carries no autonomy
tier — but it is scope-filtered exactly as a tool is, so a passport holding
fewer scopes is served fewer documents.

### capabilities

`margince://capabilities` · application/json

**What this installation can do**

The verbs this passport may call, which of them execute directly and which stage for a human decision, and the scopes it holds. Names and governance only — the input schemas live in tools/list.

### query_vocabulary

`margince://schema/query` · application/json

**Workspace query vocabulary**

Everything a query plan may say, for you: the record types you can ask about, the fields you can name on each, the operators each field admits, and the single relationship hop a plan may take. A plan naming anything outside it is refused rather than approximated.

### record_fields

`margince://schema/record-fields` · application/json

**Record write vocabulary**

The fields create_record and update_record accept for each record_type: which are required, what shape each takes, and the values the closed ones admit. The two tools name this document instead of carrying it.

### report_vocabulary

`margince://schema/reports` · application/json

**Report plan vocabulary**

What each prebuilt report accepts in a run_report plan: the names its group_by, filters and aggregates admit, what it answers with no plan at all, and what a filter means when its name alone does not say. run_report names this document instead of carrying it.

### report_blocks

`margince://schema/report-blocks` · application/json

**Report block grammar**

The blocks a report may carry: each kind, whether it renders figures, words or both, and the severities a callout may state. compose_analytics_report names this document instead of carrying it.

### analytics-schema

`margince://schema/analytics` · text/plain

**Analytics query vocabulary**

The populations a run_analytics_query plan may name, each with its group_by dimensions and its measures, derived for this seat. run_analytics_query names this document instead of carrying it.

### account_brief_view

`ui://margince/account-brief.html` · text/html;profile=mcp-app

**Morning brief**

The ranked brief queue, with the factor decomposition each item ranked on.

### account_coverage

**Relationship coverage on a deal**

Answer "is this deal covered?": which roles on the account we have a relationship with, and where the deal is exposed to a single contact. It assesses the relationships recorded against one deal's account, not the deal's commercial health — nothing here says whether the deal will close. Use whats_slipping_this_week for deals at risk of stalling, and intro_path_to when the answer is that a gap needs a warm route filling it. Keep the deal_id and the named gaps; they are what a follow-up plan is built from. Each stakeholder carries `person_name` beside its role — say WHO the uncovered seat is rather than reporting the role alone, because the answer a rep acts on is a person to bring into the room. A seat with no name is one this caller may not read: report the gap, and do not guess who fills it. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### advance_deal

**Advance a deal to a stage**

Move a deal to a different stage of its pipeline. The stage is named by id from list_pipelines — call it first; a deal you read carries only its current stage. Moving onto or off a won/lost stage is a person's decision: staged for approval, with a lost_reason for a losing stage. Read the target stage's semantic rather than guessing from its name. Use progress_deal when the move should also leave a note explaining it, which is almost always what a person means by moving a deal on. Send if_version with the version you read of the deal, and keep the staged approval id when a closing move comes back for approval. (Governance: some calls run immediately and others a person approves first, decided per call from its arguments; requires passport scope "write".)

### advance_project_phase

**Move a project to a phase**

Move a project to another phase — initiative, pursuing, delivering, closed. The four names are fixed but the order is not enforced: a project may go back a phase, and a closed one may be reopened. Closing requires a reason, which is recorded on the phase history either way. Use advance_deal for a deal's pipeline stages; a project's phases are a different vocabulary on a different record. Send if_version with the version you read; a person approves the move before it runs. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### annotate_brief

**Write findings onto the morning brief**

Write what you found onto the morning brief you just read: one sentence about the night as a whole, and for each deal you looked at, why it is on the list, what changed, and the one next move you would make. It writes onto that person's own brief for today and nothing else — it cannot be pointed at another person, another day, or a deal that is not already in their queue, and it cannot change the ranking. Every evidence id you cite must be one the brief already recorded for that item; citing anything else refuses the whole write, so cite from what read_brief gave you rather than from memory. Use log_activity to record something that happened on a deal, which belongs on the record itself and outlives today's brief. Calling it again replaces what you wrote before, so a second pass is a correction rather than an addition. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### apply_tag

**Apply a tag to a record**

Tag a person, company, deal, lead or project by tag_id, or by tag_name, which must name a tag the workspace already has. This tool never creates a tag: an unknown name is refused, and only an admin or ops seat can add a word to the vocabulary. A name matches case-insensitively; an archived word is refused as archived rather than as unknown. Prefer a tag_id from list_tags. The same tag twice is a conflict. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### archive_record

**Archive a record**

Retire a record that should no longer be worked — a duplicate, a dead account, a project that ended. Archiving hides the record from day-to-day work; it does not delete it and does not move anything attached to it, so an archived duplicate still holds the activities and deals that were logged against it. Use merge_records when a duplicate's history should end up on the record that survives, and disqualify_lead when a lead is going nowhere — a lead's own transition records the reason where archiving would not. A person approves this call before it runs; do not report the record as archived until the retry that carries their approval has answered. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### at_risk_relationships

**Relationships going cold**

Answer "where are our relationships thin?": across the caller's OPEN deals, the ones resting on a single contact, missing an engaged champion, or carried almost entirely by one person on our side. It sweeps open deals — a deal already won or lost is not at risk and is left out — and it takes no arguments, because the caller's own visibility already decides which deals these are. It is about the shape of the relationships around a deal, not about the deal's own momentum. Use whats_slipping_this_week when the question is about deals losing momentum, and account_coverage when the question is about one deal rather than the whole book. Each finding names its deal_id and the people it is about; those are what intro_path_to and who_knows take next. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### book_meeting

**Book a meeting**

Hold a slot in the host's calendar and record the meeting against the records it is about. Needs at least one link saying what it is about. The slot is taken and the meeting is a real commitment, so a person approves it first. No attendee list: who is invited is the calendar connection's business. Check the slot is free first — this tool does not. Use check_availability to find the time, and log_activity to record a meeting that already happened. Keep the staged approval id and re-send the identical start, end and links: the approval is bound to the meeting as it was described. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "send".)

### catch_me_up_on

**Catch me up on a record**

Answer "what has been going on with this?" for one person, company, deal, lead, project or meeting: the recent activity and related records in one picture, with the evidence each part rests on. Built around ONE record you name; everything it reports carries a source, and what cannot be evidenced is absent rather than inferred. prep_for_meeting when a meeting is about to happen, read_record for the record's own stored fields, search_records when you do not yet know which record you mean. Each item carries the record_type and record_id a follow-up call acts on. occurred_at is when an item happened, in UTC — prefer it over a date the prose recalls, and convert before naming a day. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### check_availability

**Check calendar availability**

Find when a host is free, so a time can be proposed to someone. It reads free/busy over the window you ask for and books nothing. It answers for one host — the acting user unless another is named — not for the invitees. Use book_meeting once a time is chosen, and prep_for_meeting when a meeting already exists and the goal is walking in ready. Keep the exact start and end of the slot you intend to take; book_meeting takes those, and a slot re-derived later may no longer be free.

### check_location_support

**Can a card read this device's location**

Find out whether this chat host lets a Margince card read the device's location, which is what would let a contact be tagged with the event you are standing at. It does not read a location and cannot: the answer comes from the card shown beside this result, and only after the person using it presses the button on that card. A host is free to refuse, and refusing is the expected outcome until one is shown not to. To record where something happened, put it in the activity you log with log_activity; this tool tags nothing and writes nothing. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

Renders its result in [`ui://margince/geo-probe.html`](#geo_probe_view), visible to `model`, `app`.

### compose_analytics_report

**Compose an analytics report**

WRITE a document somebody reads — a board-pack section, a summary for a meeting, a written-up answer with figures in it — whose every number comes from a saved analytics run instead of being typed. The document carries the STRUCTURE and the WORDS; each figure names a run id and a cell inside it, and the server resolves those handles under the reader's own authority. It writes no number of its own and refuses any document that does. A block carrying a literal figure is refused EVEN WHEN a valid handle sits beside it: the literal is what renders, the two can disagree, and no reader could tell the page shows a figure the database never computed. Save a run first — run an analytics query with save, and cite the run id it answers with. Ask run_analytics_query for one number when a figure is what is wanted. This composes a DOCUMENT of several, which is worth the round trip only when the answer is a report somebody reads. describe_report_blocks holds the block kinds and their fields for a caller that wants them before composing. Never put a number in a block — cite the cell that holds it. A block kind outside the grammar is refused BY NAME with the whole set, so a first attempt costs one refusal rather than a lookup. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### create_record

**Create a record**

Create a person, organization, deal, lead, project, activity or relationship that does not exist yet. Creating a deal requires a pipeline_id and a stage_id, and list_pipelines is what yields them for a deal that does not exist yet. Only the fields the chosen record_type actually stores are accepted, and a field belonging to a neighbouring type is refused rather than dropped. A PERSON created here is visible to the human you are acting for and to nobody else, until they publish it or correspondence with that address earns a widening verdict — attending a meeting together does not earn one. Do not tell anyone a contact you just created is on their colleagues' screens. Search first when the record might already exist — a second copy of a person or account is a problem that then needs merge_records to undo. The new record's id comes back in the result; keep it for anything that links to it. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### create_tag

**Create a tag**

Coin a new word in the workspace vocabulary, so records can be grouped by it. list_tags FIRST: a workspace with "Key Account" does not want "key accounts" beside it, and the two then split the records that belong together. A name already taken is a conflict, matched case-insensitively — including a RETIRED word holding it, which a person restores in Settings; no tool does. Needs the tag.create grant, which an ordinary seat does not hold. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### data_coverage

**How current the sources are**

Which connectors the nightly check could read, and how far back each reaches. Needs the data_coverage grant, which operators hold and sellers do not — a refusal here is a seat boundary, not a missing run. Only a `checked` source carries a date. On any other state nothing was read, and a quiet week is indistinguishable from a broken connector until somebody looks. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### decide_approval

**Approve or reject one staged action**

Answer one staged action for the person asking you: approve it, which lets it happen, or reject it, which discards it. The verdict is theirs — take an explicit approve or reject rather than deciding what they would have wanted. Approving is what makes the change real, including sending a message that was only drafted; a rejection cannot be taken back. An item already answered, or lapsed, is reported as such and nothing is written. read_approval when they have not seen what it holds; decide_approval_bundle for every proposal one act staged. If the proposal is your OWN refused call, approving does not perform it — re-issue that same call with approval_id set. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### decide_approval_bundle

**Approve or reject one act's proposals together**

Answer every still-waiting proposal that one act staged together — the overnight run that proposed six corrections is six proposals under one bundle_id. Each member is answered on its own terms and reported on its own; one already decided, or lapsed, is left as it is. Members the person could not decide alone are not decided here, and a bundle holding none of theirs reads as not found. decide_approval answers a single item; list_approvals is where a bundle_id comes from. Each member carries its own outcome — decided here, already decided, or expired. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### demote_lead

**Reverse a lead promotion**

Reverse a promotion that should not have happened, putting the lead back on the open ladder. It blocks rather than orphans: a promotion whose person now owns a deal is refused, and activities captured since the promotion stay on the person's timeline — they are real history. A promotion that merged into an existing person leaves that person untouched and only clears the lineage. Use disqualify_lead when the lead is real but going nowhere; demotion says the promotion itself was wrong. The lead is demoted when this call answers. Where an installation has raised this verb to confirm first, the answer is a staged approval instead — keep its id, and do not report the demotion until the retry carrying it has answered. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### describe_analytics_vocabulary

**Describe the analytics vocabulary**

Answer what an analytics query may SAY for THIS seat: the populations that can be measured, the group_by dimensions and measures each carries, and the aggregate functions and filter operators the grammar takes. It is the vocabulary run_analytics_query refuses against, so it holds the spelling of a population or field a query got wrong. It describes the vocabulary; it computes nothing — run_analytics_query does that. The document is derived per caller and narrowed to what this seat may already see, so a withheld field is simply absent rather than marked. It answers the same document as the margince://schema/analytics resource, for a caller that reads tools rather than resources. Call run_analytics_query directly when the names are already known — an unknown population is refused with the allowed set, so a near-miss costs one round trip rather than a lookup. Take population, dimension and measure names verbatim — a name outside the document is refused rather than approximated. The version line is the schema_version a saved run answers with.

### describe_query_vocabulary

**Describe the query vocabulary**

Answer what a query plan may SAY in this workspace: the record types that can be asked about, the fields nameable on each, the operators each field admits, and the one relationship hop a plan may take. It is the vocabulary query_workspace refuses against, so it holds the spelling of a field whose name a plan got wrong. It describes the vocabulary; it returns no records — query_workspace does that. What comes back is narrowed to what you may already read, so it names nothing you could not otherwise reach. Call query_workspace once you know the names. This tool answers the same document as the margince://schema/query resource, for a client that reads tools rather than resources. Take the field and operator names from `targets` verbatim — a plan naming anything outside them is refused rather than approximated, so guessing at a spelling costs a round trip. `grammar` says how the clauses are assembled, and `version` is the value a plan's own `version` member must carry.

### describe_report_blocks

**Describe the report block grammar**

Answer what a compose_analytics_report document may CONTAIN: every block kind, whether it renders figures or words, and the severities a callout may state. It describes the grammar; it composes nothing and returns no numbers. It is NOT a prerequisite — an unknown block kind is refused by name with the whole set, so a first attempt costs one refusal. The grammar is the same for every caller, because it is the engine's and not a workspace's. Compose directly when the blocks needed are the obvious ones, and read the refusal when a kind is wrong — it carries the accepted set. This tool answers the same document as the margince://schema/report-blocks resource, for a caller that reads tools rather than resources. A figure is never written into a block, only cited: every number names a saved run and a cell inside it. A block carrying a literal number is refused even beside a valid citation.

### describe_report_vocabulary

**Describe the report vocabulary**

Answer what a run_report plan may SAY: for each prebuilt report, the names its group_by, filters and aggregates admit, what it answers with no plan at all, and what a name means when the name alone does not say. It is the vocabulary run_report refuses against, so it holds the spelling of a name a plan got wrong. It describes the reports; it runs none and returns no numbers — run_report does that. It is NOT a prerequisite: run_report with `report` alone answers that report's default question and needs nothing from here, so reach for this only when a plan has to name a grouping, a filter or a measure. The names are the same for every caller, because a report's vocabulary is the engine's and not a workspace's. Call run_report directly when the report's default answer is the answer wanted, and read its refusal when a name is wrong — it carries that argument's accepted list. This tool answers the same document as the margince://schema/reports resource, for a caller that reads tools rather than resources. Take the names from a report's `group_by`, `filters` and `aggregates` verbatim — a plan naming anything outside them is refused rather than approximated. `filters` is one object holding both equality predicates and numeric thresholds, so a threshold key goes there and not in a slot of its own.

### disqualify_lead

**Disqualify a lead**

Close out a lead that is not going anywhere, so it stops appearing as live work. It is the lead's own terminal state and keeps the record and its history; it is not a deletion and not an archive. Use promote_lead when engagement says the opposite, and qualify_lead when the lead is only missing information. A person approves this call before it runs; do not report the lead as disqualified until the retry carrying their approval has answered.

### draft_email

**Draft an email**

Compose an email: a reply to a recorded thread (activity_id), or a FIRST message to a record (links). It writes the message and stops: nothing is sent. With no drafting model configured the text is a short deterministic note rather than a composed one. draft_follow_ups_for drafts across a set of slipping deals at once; send_email sends a reply, send_account_email a first message. Keep what comes back — subject, body, and the activity_id or links echoed with it; the send takes them. Re-writing the text in between means a person approves one message and another goes out. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "draft".)

### draft_follow_ups_for

**Draft follow-ups**

Draft a follow-up for each deal in a segment at once — today only the slipping deals — and leave each draft on its own deal's timeline. It writes drafts and sends none of them, and it drafts only for deals whose risk is evidenced, so it covers the same set whats_slipping_this_week reports. One call writes to many records, up to a server-side ceiling of 25. Use draft_email for one specific conversation; this tool answers "chase everything that is slipping", not "reply to this". Each draft comes back with its deal_id and draft_activity_id — those are how a person finds the drafts to review. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "draft".)

### enrich

**Enrich an organization from its website**

Learn about an organization by reading its public website, and propose what was found for a person to accept onto the record. It reaches OUTSIDE the workspace, so a person approves the call before it runs, and what it returns is a proposal — nothing lands on the record until someone accepts it. Reading one page answers immediately; reading a whole site is queued and answers with a read id rather than the content. What it finds is captured text from a third party, not a fact this workspace has verified. Use qualify_lead when the missing values are already derivable from the record itself, which costs no external read and needs no approval. Keep the organization_id you enriched, and the read id when a whole-site read was queued — the result is collected against it later. (Governance: a person approves every call before it runs; requires passport scope "enrich".)

### forecast_input_checks

**What the forecast's inputs were checked against**

What last night's input check found, and how much of the pipeline it reached. A forecast is only as good as its inputs, and the failures are mundane: a close date that went by, an amount that disagrees with the offer that was sent, a deal nobody has heard from in ninety days. Read `readiness` before quoting any forecast figure. `checks_incomplete` is NOT a worse `needs_review` — one says the pipeline has problems, the other says we could not look, and reporting the first when the second is true tells somebody their pipeline is sound when nobody read the mailbox. `sources` says why: each carries the state the run reached, and only a `checked` source has a date. An absent or unread source means the run could not confirm anything from it, which is different from finding nothing there. `eligible_deals` is how much there was to check — compared against an earlier run it shows a pass that covered less of the pipeline. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### forecast_movement

**What moved the forecast**

The difference between two forecast snapshots, classified into named causes. Opening plus every bucket equals closing, exactly — so the buckets are a complete account of the change and not a selection from it. A deal appears in exactly ONE bucket: one that both slipped and was repriced has moved for one reason as far as a reader is concerned, which is that it left. Two buckets are about the machinery rather than the business, and quoting them as sales movement is the mistake this classification exists to prevent. `definition` means the two snapshots were computed under different rules, and then the WHOLE difference is in that bucket. `model` means a probability the product re-scored. `reopened_or_archived` carries a deal that left the population entirely — archived, or no longer visible to this caller — with its whole prior contribution, so no money disappears without a row that says where it went. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### forecast_readings

**Read the forecast**

What a period is expected to close, in four readings. `won` counts deals by the day they ACTUALLY closed, not the day they were expected to. `evidence` is committed pipeline whose close date somebody confirmed; a provisional date stays in `open` and out of `evidence`. `coverage_note` says what the totals do not cover, and it is absent only when they cover every eligible deal — so quoting a total without it reports a partial pipeline as a complete one. `eligible_count`, `priced_count` and `fx_missing_count` are the counts it is written from. Quote `as_of`, `timezone` and `base_currency` with the number: a total placed in the reader's own zone is a different total. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### get_record_tags

**Get a record's tags**

Read the tags on one person, company or deal, with who applied each and when. Those three record types only. `withheld` true means the vocabulary is not visible to this caller, so the list is empty for that reason — NOT because the record carries no tags, and it must not be reported as none. An archived tag stays on whatever carries it. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

Read one tag and how many people, companies and deals carry it. The counts cover those three record types only. They say how much retiring or merging the word would touch; the records themselves come from list_records. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### intro_path_to

**Find a warm introduction path**

Find a warm route into a company: who we already know there, and which colleague could make the introduction. It walks the relationships this workspace has recorded. An account nobody here has ever spoken to has no warm path, and saying so is the correct answer rather than a failure. Use who_knows when you already have the specific person and want the colleagues who know THEM, and search_records when you are still looking for the account itself. The path names the colleague and the contact by id; both are needed to ask anyone for the introduction. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### list_approvals

**List what is waiting for a decision**

The staged actions waiting for a person's decision: what was proposed and what each would do. It is where a proposal that is already waiting turns up — a message staged and unsent is not one that needs writing again. It lists what the person you act for could decide themselves; anything else is absent rather than refused. A proposal past its expiry reads as expired and can no longer be answered. Each item carries its one-line summary, not the change itself. read_approval opens one and shows what it holds; decide_approval answers it. Keep the staged_action_id you mean to act on, the bundle_id when one act staged several, and next_cursor. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### list_channel_providers

**List messaging transports**

Find out which messaging transports exist in THIS installation, and what each is called. It reports what the installation composed, not what this workspace has connected. supplies_transport=false means the transport cannot carry an outbound message at all, so a reply on it will be refused however the conversation was captured. To read the messages themselves, use search_records on activities and filter by channel_provider. Carry the `provider` value verbatim: log_activity requires it as channel_provider whenever kind is "message", and a value not in this list fails a foreign key. Use `label` only for display. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### list_colleagues

**List colleagues**

List the people who work HERE — colleagues holding a seat, not the contacts stored as person records. Reads only, and lists seats that can actually receive work — archived, suspended and locked-out ones are absent. `truncated` means there are more. A `q` matching nobody answers with `all_colleagues` and a warning; that list is ABSENT if it could not be read and partial if `all_colleagues_truncated`, so read the warning before concluding a person has no seat. search_records/person finds a CUSTOMER contact; this finds a colleague. user_id is what assignee_id and owner_id take. Never assign to an is_agent seat. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### list_input_checks

**What the forecast's inputs still need**

The open findings from the nightly input check, most material first. Read them before quoting a forecast figure: a close date that went by, or an amount that disagrees with the offer that was sent, makes a total wrong without making the arithmetic wrong. Scoped to what this caller can open, with no count of what was withheld — a count of what somebody may not read is itself a statement about how much there is. `affected_minor` absent means the money at stake cannot be said, not that nothing is at stake. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### list_pipelines

**List pipelines and their stages**

List every pipeline this workspace has with its live stages — the configuration the deal-shaped writes are named against. It is where the id of a stage a deal could move TO comes from, so a deal cannot be created, or moved anywhere new, without calling this first — a deal you have already read carries only the stage it is in. Each stage carries a semantic — open, won or lost — and that, not its name, is what decides whether moving onto it needs a person's approval; a stage called "Closed" may be either. Keep the pipeline_id and the stage_id of the stage you mean: create_record for a deal requires both, and advance_deal and progress_deal take that stage_id as their to_stage_id. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### list_records

**List records**

Enumerate the people, organizations, deals, leads or projects that meet exact conditions — every deal in one pipeline, the leads one person owns, the projects still being delivered. It narrows only by the filters this workspace publishes for that record_type, which the schema lists per type, and it answers ONE page: the set continues past it. Use search_records when the question is what a record is called rather than which records meet a condition, and run_report when the answer is a count or a total rather than the records themselves. Keep next_cursor and pass it back to read the next page — a second call without it re-reads the first one. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### list_tags

**List tags**

The workspace's words for grouping records, with the tag_id apply_tag takes. Archived words come only on request and cannot be applied. `truncated` means the list was cut, so a word missing from it may still exist. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### log_activity

**Log an activity**

Record something that happened — a call, a meeting, a note, a message — on the records it was about: name every one of them in this call. A meeting is with a person, and also concerns their company and the deal it is for. It writes history and changes nothing else: no deal moves, no field updates, nobody is notified. Unlinked, it appears on no timeline, and adding a link afterwards is a second call — relink_activity — which a person has to approve when it files under a project. Use progress_deal when the same event also moves a deal, so move and note are one act; create_task for something still owed. Keep the activity id — draft_email, send_email and send_message identify a conversation by it. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### merge_records

**Merge two records**

Collapse two records for the same real person or company into one, moving the source's activities, deals and links onto the record that survives. People merge with people and organizations with organizations; the source is archived and redirected to the target, and the direction is not reversible by calling this again the other way round. Use archive_record when the extra record has nothing worth keeping, rather than merging to make it disappear. target_id is the record that survives and source_id the one merged away — read both records before choosing, because a person approves the call as you described it. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### merge_tags

**Fold one tag into another**

Fold a duplicate word into the one the workspace keeps, moving every record that carries it. NOT UNDOABLE once approved: the source is retired, its name is released — links to it stop working and someone may coin it again — and no pointer home is kept, unlike a person or company merge. The TARGET is the word that survives; read both with get_tag first. Needs the tag.update grant. (Governance: a person approves every call before it runs; requires passport scope "write".)

### prep_for_meeting

**Prepare for a meeting**

Get ready for a specific meeting: given the meeting, the same written brief a person reads; given any other record, the assembled picture a catch-up gives, plus the open items pulled out as the things to raise. It is built around ONE record you name, and everything it reports carries a source; what cannot be evidenced is absent rather than inferred. Given a meeting it works out which record that meeting is about and names the others alongside. Use catch_me_up_on when there is no meeting and the question is simply what has been happening, and check_availability when the goal is finding a time rather than preparing for one. The focus list names the open items by record_id; those are what to act on after the meeting. prepared_for names the record the prep was built around. occurred_at is when an item happened, in UTC — prefer it over a date the prose recalls. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### prepare_handoff

**Prepare a delivery handoff**

Assemble what the delivery side of one project needs from the sales side: who owns it, who to call at the client, what was sold, by when, and what is already promised — with a named gap for each of those the records do not answer. It reports what the records say and reads nothing outside them; each gap names the field it was read off. It is scoped to the records the caller may see, so a gap means the field is empty as far as THEY can see, and a bounded list withholds the gaps that claim something is absent rather than guessing them. It changes nothing — preparing a handover is not performing one. Use catch_me_up_on when the question is what has been happening on the account rather than what a handover is missing, and read_record for the project's own stored fields alone. The project_id, and each gap's source field — the gaps are what a follow-up fills in. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

Renders its result in [`ui://margince/handoff.html`](#handoff_view), visible to `model`, `app`.

### preview_import

**Preview an import**

Bring a spreadsheet in: send the CSV as text and this checks every row against the workspace and reports what importing it would do. Writes nothing. `object` is organization, person or lead. Use `person` for a file the business already knows — a migration off another CRM, a corrected export coming back. Use `lead` for a machine-sourced list nobody has worked yet; those land unworked and a human promotes them. A row naming a record already here is counted in `duplicates`, and created unless on_duplicate is skip — except a person whose email is already held, which is always refused, because an email is a real key. A company's Website or Domain column maps to `domain`, which is what identifies a company — import it and dedupe stops guessing from names. To link people to their employers, map the company column to `organization_name` — import the companies FIRST, because a name that matches nothing links nothing and says so. To CORRECT companies rather than add them, map a column to `id`, then give a row the id of the company it corrects — read them out first. A row whose `id` is EMPTY is a new company, so one file may both correct and add. create_record for one record you already know. run_id, and `duplicates` — give the user both numbers before committing. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### progress_deal

**Progress a deal with a note**

Move a deal to a new stage and leave a note on its timeline saying why, in one call. The move commits first and the note follows it, so a note that fails to write does not put the deal back — the answer says so, and the note is then log_activity's to retry. The note itself is optional. Same rules as the bare move otherwise: call list_pipelines for the id of the stage you are moving to, and moving onto or off a stage that closes a deal as won or lost is staged for a person to approve. Use advance_deal when there is genuinely nothing to say about the move, and log_activity when something happened but the deal did not move. Send if_version with the version you read of the deal; keep the staged approval id if a closing move is sent for approval. (Governance: some calls run immediately and others a person approves first, decided per call from its arguments; requires passport scope "write".)

### promote_lead

**Promote a lead to a person**

Turn a lead who has genuinely engaged into a person record, carrying their history across. It requires a trigger naming the engagement that justifies it — a reply, a booked or held meeting, or a human's decision. Cold outreach that nobody answered is not a promotion, and there is no trigger for it. Use qualify_lead when the lead is merely incomplete rather than ready, and disqualify_lead when the engagement says the opposite. A person approves this call before it runs; the promoted person's id comes back only from the retry that carries their approval. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### qualify_lead

**Qualify a lead**

Fill in what a lead's own data already implies — today the company name, from the domain of its email address — and report which qualification fields are still empty. It fills only a field that is currently EMPTY and derivable from the lead itself. It never overwrites a value, never invents one, and reaches nothing outside the record, so a lead with nothing to derive from comes back unchanged with its gaps named. Use enrich to learn about a company from its website, and promote_lead once a real engagement means the lead should become a person. The gaps in the result are what a human still has to supply; they are the honest answer to "is this lead ready", not a failure of the call.

### query_workspace

**Query the workspace**

Answer a question that has STRUCTURE — a record type, conditions on its fields, a hop to a related record, or a likeness to describe — by sending a plan and reading back the records that satisfy it, together with what kind of answer it is. Every name in a plan comes from the published vocabulary; one outside it is refused by name. The margince://schema/query resource — not this description — says which record types, fields, operators and relationships can be asked about. At most one similarity clause and one hop. It cannot group, count or total, and has no cursor: an answer that hit its limit says so. Use search_records when you only have a name or a phrase and no conditions to apply, and run_report when the answer wanted is a count, a total or a breakdown rather than the records themselves. Read `coverage` before you use the rows: `complete_exact` means every record matching the plan is here, `ranked_semantic` means these ranked highest and others may match, and `partial_degraded` means something in the plan could not be answered as asked — `notes` says which. Keep each row's record_type and id for any follow-up call, and its `evidence` for the related record that admitted it. A row's `owner` is the colleague who holds that account: rows come back from across the whole workspace, so most of them belong to someone other than the person asking. When `owner.is_you` is false, say whose it is when you report the record, and treat contacting it as theirs to decide rather than advising an approach as though the account were unowned. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### read_approval

**Read one staged action in full**

Read one staged action in full: the exact change proposed, the record it acts on, and the evidence it was formed on — enough to answer it without opening the app. Reading performs nothing. An id the person you act for could not decide answers as not found, exactly as an id naming nothing does. list_approvals yields the id; decide_approval answers it. Keep the staged_action_id, and the bundle_id if the item names one. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### read_brief

**Read the morning brief**

Read the ranked queue the person you act for sees when they open their morning brief — the deals the workspace decided are worth their attention today, in order, with the rows behind each ranking. It re-reads the last assembled run rather than building a new one, so its as_of says how current it is, and it is that person's own queue: it cannot be asked for anyone else's. Acting on, dismissing or snoozing an item is theirs alone. Use whats_slipping_this_week when the question is which deals are losing momentum regardless of what today's brief chose, and read_record for what one of these deals currently says. Each item names a deal_id and its evidence_ids; read those to cite what the ranking rested on rather than restating the item's own summary. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

Renders its result in [`ui://margince/account-brief.html`](#account_brief_view), visible to `model`, `app`.

### read_project_360

**Read a project's page**

Read one project's whole page: company, phase history with time per phase, deals, stakeholders, contracts, documents, open commitments, timeline, filing coverage, totals. Each section is cut at 25 rows and carries a truncated flag; sections_omitted names what your grants withhold. prepare_handoff for the delivery gaps, read_record for the project's stored fields alone. The project_id, and the deal, person and task ids a follow-up acts on. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### read_record

**Read a record**

Read one record's own stored fields — the values a person would see on its detail page — when you already know which record you mean. It returns that record and nothing around it: no timeline, no related people, no deals on the account. Use catch_me_up_on when the goal is what has been happening on the record rather than what it currently says. Keep the version from the result and pass it back as if_version on a later update, so a write is refused rather than silently overwriting a change made in between. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### relink_activities

**Re-associate a set of activities to a record**

Move up to 500 named activities onto one record, all or nothing. Each id must be visible and writable to you. A project destination needs a human. relink_thread moves one conversation. The answer lists the ids moved. (Governance: some calls run immediately and others a person approves first, decided per call from its arguments; requires passport scope "write".)

### relink_activity

**Re-associate an activity to a record**

Fix what a recorded activity is about, when a captured mail or meeting landed on the wrong record or on none. Changes only the association; content is untouched. By default the new link is ADDED beside existing ones. log_activity records an event not recorded yet; relink_thread moves a whole conversation; relink_activities a picked set. Set replace_existing_of_type to move rather than associate. (Governance: some calls run immediately and others a person approves first, decided per call from its arguments; requires passport scope "write".)

### remove_tag

**Take a tag off a record**

Take one tag off one record — by tag_id or tag_name — leaving the word itself. Removing one that is not there succeeds. archive_record on a tag retires it for all. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### resolve_entities

**Resolve people and companies**

Find out whether the people and companies named in something you are holding already exist here, matched on addresses, phone numbers and company domains rather than on text. It reads only. Nothing is created, changed or merged, and it answers person and organization, never leads. A near match comes back `ambiguous` however close it is. Use search_records to find a record you know exists, and merge_records once a person has decided that two records are one. Call this BEFORE creating a person or company from anything you did not type. Act on `matched`; on `ambiguous` ask which is meant; on `unresolved` say what you will create — a miss is not proof nothing exists. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### review_commitments

**Review open commitments**

Answer "what have we promised and not delivered?": the open promises across the workspace, most overdue first, from BOTH places a promise is recorded — a task somebody filed, and a commitment read out of a captured conversation, which carries the sentence it was read from. Each names when it came due and the record it was made about. It reads what the workspace captured: a promise made in an uncaptured call, or in a thread nobody filed, is absent. The two sources are not linked, so a promise both said and typed can appear twice. Narrowing by assignee or project returns recorded TASKS alone — a conversation commitment carries neither — so a narrowed answer is a smaller question than the unnarrowed one. It is scoped to the records the caller may see. Use whats_slipping_this_week when the question is which DEALS are at risk rather than which promises are outstanding, and catch_me_up_on for everything that has happened on one record. Each item carries source (task | conversation) and the id for that source — task_id or claim_id — plus assignee_id where a task has one. Every state is judged against as_of, so carry that too if you report the answer later. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### run_analytics_query

**Run an analytics query**

Compute a grouped aggregate — counts, sums, averages, medians — over a governed population, in the database. The answer carries its columns, rows and schema version; groups too small to disclose are withheld, never estimated. Populations, dimensions and measures come from margince://schema/analytics, derived for this seat and answered by describe_analytics_vocabulary; a name outside it is refused with what would work. Money measures are minor units. An omitted scope is this seat's own default population, never the workspace. run_report answers a prebuilt report by key; query_workspace lists exact records; the forecast tools answer forecast readings and movement. This one is for a novel aggregate no prebuilt report shapes. Set save to get a run_id whose cells compose_analytics_report can cite; without it the answer is served once and not stored. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### run_report

**Run a report**

Answer a question about totals, counts or breakdowns — pipeline by stage, deals won by owner, activity volume over time — by running one of this workspace's prebuilt reports. Only the named reports exist, each with its own filter, grouping and measure names; anything else is refused. It aggregates: how many and how much, never which record. Use search_records or whats_slipping_this_week when the answer wanted is the records themselves rather than a number over them. Call a report with no plan first to see its default answer, then narrow with the names its catalog entry lists. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### search_context

**Search for relevant material**

Find the records most relevant to a description, ranked by meaning as well as by wording, each with the excerpt that ranked it. Ranked, never exhaustive: records that also match may be absent, and no count of them exists. You can narrow it to particular record types, but not by field, date or owner, and it does not group or total. It cannot be narrowed to a project either: the index carries no project column, so use catch_me_up_on with project_id for that. Use query_workspace when the question has conditions, a date bound or a related record to reach through, and search_records when you have the exact name or phrase. Read `coverage`: `partial_degraded` means `notes` matters, and `semantic_ranking_degraded_to_lexical` there means the ranking fell back to word overlap. Keep each hit's record_type and id. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### search_records

**Search records**

Find people, organizations, deals, leads and projects when you know roughly what they are called but not which record they are. It matches text stored ON the record. It does not read a timeline: message bodies, call notes and meeting content are not searched, so a query describing what someone said or did will not find them. Use list_records when the question is which records meet a condition rather than what one is called, read_record when you already hold the record's id, and run_report when the question is a count, a total or a breakdown rather than a set of records. Keep each result's record_type and id together: every other tool identifies a record by both, and an id alone does not say which type it belongs to. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### send_account_email

**Start an email conversation from a record**

Put a mail on the wire to a real recipient, from this workspace, starting a new conversation rather than answering one, and file it on the records it is about. Sends EXACTLY the subject and body given; composes nothing. Needs at least one link naming the records it belongs to. Every recipient must have granted the named consent purpose, and a person approves the send first — a sent mail cannot be recalled. Use send_email to answer a conversation already recorded here; this starts a separate thread beside it. Keep the staged approval id and re-send the identical text and links: the approval is bound to that exact message. The activity_id that comes back is the new conversation. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "send".)

### send_email

**Send an email**

Put a mail on the wire to a real recipient, from this workspace, and record it on the thread it belongs to. It sends EXACTLY the subject and body it is given and composes nothing, so it is not the tool to reach for when the message does not exist yet. Every recipient must have granted the consent purpose the call names, and a person approves the send before it leaves — a message leaving the workspace cannot be recalled. Use draft_email first to produce the message and let it be read, and send_message when the conversation is on a chat channel rather than mail. Send the same activity_id, subject and body the draft produced, and keep the staged approval id: the approval is bound to that exact message, so changed text needs a new approval. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "send".)

### send_message

**Reply on a channel conversation**

Reply on a captured chat conversation — the channels this workspace has connected — on the thread it was captured from. It replies to an existing conversation named by activity_id; it cannot start one, and it cannot choose a channel. The recipient must have granted the consent purpose the call names, and a person approves it before it leaves. Use send_email when the thread is a mail thread, and log_activity when the point is to record that something was said rather than to say it. Keep the activity_id of the conversation and the staged approval id; the approval binds the exact text, so changed text needs a new approval. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "send".)

### update_record

**Update a record**

Change stored field values on a record that already exists — a corrected title, an amount, an expected close date. Only the fields you send change, and only the fields the record type stores (a person's email addresses are not among them). A field a HUMAN last set is not overwritten: that part is staged for a person and named in the result, and that part of the write has not happened. It names the record by id; when a name matches two records, a person picks. owner_id is NOT neutral — ownership decides visibility, so reassigning moves the record onto someone else's book and can take it off the owner's. Use advance_deal or progress_deal to move a deal between stages, and relink_activity to change what an activity is about; neither is a field edit. Send if_version with the version you read, and keep the staged approval id from the result if you intend to retry the same change once a human has released it. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### update_tag

**Rename or recolour a tag**

Rename, recolour or describe a word that already exists. Fields left out are unchanged, so a recolour need not restate the name. The word keeps every record carrying it — this changes what it is CALLED, not what it is on. LAST WRITE WINS: this tool sends no version, so an edit made between your read and your write is overwritten without a conflict. Read with get_tag immediately before editing. A name another word already holds is a conflict. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "write".)

### whats_slipping_this_week

**What's slipping this week**

Answer "what is slipping?": the deals going quiet or running past their expected close date, ranked worst first, each with the evidence that says so. It reports only deals whose risk can be evidenced from their own fields — a deal nobody can point at a reason for is absent rather than guessed — and it is scoped to the deals the caller may see. Use run_report for the pipeline as a whole (totals, counts, breakdowns), and at_risk_relationships when the question is who a deal rests on rather than whether it is moving. Keep each deal_id if you intend to act; draft_follow_ups_for works over this same ranked set without you re-deriving it. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

### who_knows

**Who knows this contact**

Answer "who here knows this person?": the colleagues with a relationship to one contact, warmest first, with the interaction counts that ground the warmth. It reports relationships this workspace can evidence from its own recorded interactions, so a genuine relationship nobody has logged does not appear. Never spoken is reported as no relationship rather than a score of zero. Use intro_path_to when you want a route into a COMPANY rather than the people who know one contact. Each colleague comes back with a user_id; the strength bucket, not the raw score, is what a person should be asked about. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)

Renders its result in [`ui://margince/relationship-map.html`](#relationship_map_view), visible to `model`, `app`.

### whoami

**Who this passport acts for**

Name the human this passport acts for: their id, display name, email and language. It reads only, and answers this call's acting user — not a directory. acting_user_id is what owner_id and assignee_id take for "me". prose_language is the language every stored sentence is written in — a note, a description, a summary — whatever language the conversation itself is in; it is always answered, where locale is absent until this person chooses one. (Governance: runs immediately; requires passport scope "read".)
