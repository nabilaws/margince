//     refuses a second row for one scope, the NULL-category scope included (a
//     plain UNIQUE would not: Postgres counts NULLs as distinct).
//   - every write resolves its scope through ParseRetentionScope, so a policy
//     can only exist for a scope this table has a selector for.
//
// Together: at most one enabled policy per selector, therefore at most
// len(retentionSelectors) policy stages. A second row for one selector is
// precisely what would make this bound a fiction, which is why both facts are
// enforced rather than assumed.
//
// The §3.4 ladder is unaffected: its rungs are different scopes (`activity` at
