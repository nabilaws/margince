// The surface had no way to name a colleague. app_user appeared in none of the
// tools, so an assistant asked to assign work searched `person` — the customer
// contacts — found two people with the right first name, and reported that
// neither was "listed under sales". The seat it wanted was the one the human
// was signed in as.
//
// That also blocked everything downstream: assignee_id and owner_id take an
// app_user id, and nothing could produce one.
//
// NOT a record type. A seat has no owner, no visibility rule and no custom
// fields, and datasource.EntityTypes is pinned to the schema's CHECK
// constraints — widening it for this would ripple through every polymorphic
// reference to say "a colleague is a kind of record", which is exactly the
// confusion this tool exists to end.
