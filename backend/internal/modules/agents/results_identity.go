// Split out of results.go when that file crossed the 500-line cap. They belong
// together: none of them is a record, all three answer a question a caller asks
// BEFORE it can name a record — whose id goes in owner_id, which colleague
// gets the task, which word to tag with.

	// A caller cannot tell them apart, and the one it picks is the wrong one:
	// asked to hand an account to a colleague, an assistant read `[]` and

	// the roster under a spelling it had not tried.

	// A POINTER, so a successful fallback over a workspace that employs nobody
