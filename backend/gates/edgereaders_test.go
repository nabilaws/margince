package gates

// `relationship` is a first-class RBAC object, and it is the only join table in
// the schema that is one. The reason is the whole obligation this gate holds:
// an edge discloses the two records it names AS A PAIR, which the grants on
// those two records do not cover. "Who works at Acme" is a fact about the pair.
//
// So every read of that table either passes the edge's own gate, or says which
// kind of read it is that does not need to. This gate asks for that verdict and
// fails a read carrying neither — because a read that quietly answers under the
// endpoints' grants is indistinguishable from one that was considered, and the
// tree has now produced nine of the first kind while a tenth sat one directory
// away doing it correctly.
//
// Why the gate is the fix rather than the helper. platform/auth.EdgeReadScope
// spells the admission once, but nothing forces a new SQL read through it — the
// tree's own precedent is explicit that one spelling holds because a gate
// enforces reaching it (RelationshipEndpointScope's "one spelling" comment, and
// composerowscope_test.go enforcing it). This is that gate.
//
// What it asks, in three derived steps:
//
//   - the SITES are every SQL string literal under internal/ naming the
//     relationship table, resolved from the literals themselves, so a new read
//     inherits the obligation with no edit here;
//   - the OBLIGATION is that the enclosing FUNCTION reaches an edge-gate
//     spelling, resolved transitively across its package;
//   - anything else carries a VERDICT in one of the four declarations below,
//     and which declaration a site sits in IS its verdict.
//
// Per FUNCTION and not per file, which is where it parts company with
// restrictedreaders_test.go's otherwise identical shape. That gate judges a
// whole file because its subject is one obligation every read in the file
// shares; here one file legitimately holds reads with DIFFERENT verdicts —
// org360/graphreads.go gates two and carries a ruling on the third — and a
// file-level answer would let the gated pair vouch for the third, which is
// precisely the hole being closed. A package-level SQL fragment has no function to belong to
// and is judged at file scope, as it is there.

// It is a real verdict and not a quiet exclusion, which is the distinction

// "handled", this reads as "decided, and not yet done". The hole stays
// countable — `go test -run TestEveryReaderOfTheRelationshipTable -v` prints
// the count.
//
// Every reason here names its issue. That is a convention rather than a checked
// rule, deliberately: a parallel map of reasons to police it is exactly what
// TestEveryPackageLevelReasonMapIsAWaiverOrADeclaredFixture refuses, because a
// gate holding its own exceptions to its own standard is how the standards
// diverge. gatekit already refuses a reason that states no cost.
//
// A deferral is a claim that the work is pending, so this set is EMPTY when
// nothing is pending — which is the state it is in now, and the state the
// census was built to reach. It stays declared rather than deleted for the
// reason the census exists at all: the next disclosing read that cannot be
// gated today needs somewhere honest to go, and a contributor who finds no such
// place invents one, or worse, quietly gates a read that should not be.
//
// The five entries this held were the four coverage reads — closed by the
// withheld channel on DealCoverage, so the seats, our side and the findings now
// come back empty AND NAMED instead of gated into a false all-clear — and the
// related-companies read, which turned out to be a ruling rather than a
// deferral and moved to ruledEdgeReads.

// recording a ruling as one leaves a hole nobody can ever close, since the
// thing it waits for is never going to happen.
